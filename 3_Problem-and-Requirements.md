# Problem and Requirements

## Problem statement: elaborated

	[-] Elaborated description and analysis of the practical problem adressed.
		[-] Root cause analysis if needed.
		
> In order to define the problem more precisely, different groups of stakeholders can be approached, e.g. managers, employees and customers as they may have different views and knowledge about various aspects of the problem. By combining contributions from different stakeholder groups the researcher can achieve a deeper and more complete explication of the problem.

**Identifying the gap**
Even before I started literature surveys, I reached out to people in the industry. According to my mission statement I wanted to identify a practical problem experienced when dealing with sensory equipment today. TK[bold statement] something about how solving practical problems are more useful than technology driven research. ~~Solving practical problems compared to technology specific research have the potential to create knowledge of more significant importance~~. I quickly identified that the routines and processes involving monitoring equipment was more or less the same between different departments and hospitals, not only on a national scale, but also international. Because of this indifference I saw no need for doing a quantitative survey between the different hospitals. For my interviews I decided to begin with unstructured interviews and open questions. This way I was able to develop a understanding of how people viewed their work and how they interpreted the technology that was part of their everyday routines. This also made the me more flexible, and I was able to do interviews on a short notice, which enabled me to talk to people in their natural working environment. I took note of people's experience with, interpretations of, and reactions to the technical monitoring systems they had at hand. While observing what people said and did, I searched for latent needs, and afterwards reflected over what they did not say or do. I noticed that the transition between bedside patients and ambulatory ones was not optimal. 

In some cases the department did not have the necessary telemetry equipment for monitoring ambulatory patients. Other times the task of installing the new equipment just so that the patient could take a walk was not carried out because there was no imminent risk of heart failure. In both cases the medical staff I spoke to expressed discontent with this practice. "To see how a recovering heart reacts to physical movement post surgery could give valuable insight in TK what insight is gained", explained Dr. Eide of Kiel University Hospital.

**Some notes on intended use**
This is important to discuss. 

**Implications**
Why does it matter? Reflect on what this problem has to say for the stakeholders

**Improvement**
Replacing the wall-mounted cables with a wireless link would improve this situation.


/**
	In order to understand the physical and cognitive strains of dealing with an ECG-system (that medical workers may have learned to disguise), I observed someone not familiar with the domain being taught how to equip a patient with ECG patches and set everything up for monitoring.

## Requirements


	[-] Define requirements of artefact, which are justified based on the problem analysis.
	[-] Can also describe:
		[-] The process of problem analysis and requirements elicitation
		[-] The application of the selected research strategies and methods and the use of the knowlege base.


This section describes the requirements for the artefact. First we outline the artefact, then an introduction of the stakeholders and their roles follow, before elaborating on non-functional requirements. Lastly, a comparison of the different stakeholders and their concerns are conducted. 


### Stakeholders

Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this project, we have to include a broad span of different stakeholders. We have divided the stakeholders into three different groups: 


**Direct users:**

- Patients: The patients themselves are the main source of physiological data. The patients are the ones in direct contact with the sensory equipment, and will act as the wearer of the  WBANs. It is important to remember that these are people admitted to the hospital with a broad span of medical conditions. They might be in pain, unconscious, or mentally exhausted. One must take these considerations into the design and requirement specification. 
- Physicians:  Physicians and clinicians are the medical staff that are responsible for care and treatment of patients, as well as operating their respective departments. They are the ones that will install the sensors on the patient.


**Product owners:**

- Technical engineer: Technical engineer is defined as the medical and biomedical maintenance engineer responsible for installing and maintaining the technical equipment used for medical purposes at hospitals. Among other things, they are responsible for doing technical maintenance  on the central heart monitoring system, which is as close as we come to an established way of monitoring vital signs of multiple patients in hospitals today.
- Purchasing organisation: Depending on the local laws, policies and governance at different hospitals and hospital regions, the purchasing routines may be different. Often these routines also differ based on what type of medical equipment this is, and itâ€™s intended use (e.g. disposable vs reusable equipment) [1][interview_heidi], [1][inett_helsedir_medtek_utstyr]. Either way, the department stakeholder represents the organisational unit(s) responsible for purchasing one or more parts of our proposed artefact. Note, because our artefact stack spans the full network stack, it also might span multiple purchasing organisations. Therefore, implementing our artefact may be difficult in practice. This is a concern for the feasibility of our artefact, and must be taken into account when developing the requirements.  


**Other stakeholders:**

- EHR vendors: The electronic health record vendors is here used as a common term describing providers of either software or cloud services for storing and managing electronic medical records/information at hospitals.  Although effort have been made to ensure interoperability across systems and vendors, these systems have traditionally been closed silos tailored for a specific hospital or medical service. This is however rapidly changing with new standards like HL7-FHIR (Fast Health Information Resources)[1][inet_hl7]. The development and adaptation of initiatives like this will be key to the success of a versatile/(platform independent?) monitoring solution that works across hospital departments and institutions.
- Device Manufacturers:
  - Medical devices: This stakeholder represents the manufacturers of medical-grade wireless monitoring nodes. Popular manufacturer of sensory equipment today include Philips, Siemens, GE and more.
  - Commercial products: This represents manufacturers of consumer technology for monitoring health and vital signs. Information gathered both before and after a person is admitted to the hospital could be of medical value.
- Commercial software providers: This stakeholder represents all the 3rd party consumer technology that track, gather and displays information from various consumer products. This stakeholder is often the same as device manufacturers, it could also be an independent company specialising in personal health services. Common for these providers is that they are in large part concerned with integrations to other services.


### Non-functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements, or qualities of the artefact.


### Functional Requirements

> ANSWER: What requirements does physicians demand from physiological sensors?
We have to answer for timelyness, ECG resolution and sample rate.
