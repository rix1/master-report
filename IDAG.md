Where standards like HL7 and the IEEE11073 family are intended to enable interoperability of product grade medical devices, we show that research prototypes benefit from the use of web technologies and simple device interfaces, as they simplify product development for a manufacturer and ease integration efforts for research teams. Embracing this approach for the development of new medical devices eases the constraint to use off-the-self products for research trails investigating innovative use of telemedicine.

Rix1:
Investigating of-the-shelf medical devices and software as well as patient monitoring practices in order to create a prototype built on  that match a subset of the minimum criteria for the existing solutions.

Other:
Effective throughput could then be degraded, and latencies throughout the system would increase. Since physiologic data has “real time” requirements, excessive latency cannot be tolerated. The perceptible effect of latency for end users is gaps in the waveform display at the central station, gaps in wave review and discontinuities in arrhythmia monitoring.
