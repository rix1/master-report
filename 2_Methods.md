## Method

	[-] Justification for the methods.

### Strategies and Methods

	[-] Overview of research strategies and methods

> TK Talk about how we found the research questions. And what process this project is going to follow. Express shortcomings in previous research.


Like in any projects studying involving people and technology there is an inherent complexity that the researchers have to unravel in order to understand the forces that guide the socio-technical systems in front of them.

When studying these systems it is important to understand why and how an artefact works in it's environment, not only that it works. This is a hot topic in the field of design and user experience, and several approaches to achieving this insight have been proposed [TK Design thinking and others]. My approach was influenced by both the Design Science methodology, my personal experience and IBM's framework for Design Thinking.

> Link your methods up to what design science say about finding data in previous research and discuss why this approach was chosen over other strategies

> Here I write about how I approached the literature review. How I gathered requirements based on interviews and how I planned my experiments.


### Data collection and analysis

	[/] Overview of methods of data collection and data analysis that have been used.

> TK Talk about how the information gathering will be conducted, and how I am going to validate my solution. Mention some considerations that will be important for the success of this project. 


### Research Ethics

	[/] Discuss research ethics

Creativity plays a big role in the creation and development of any artefact, and creativity love  accidents and surprises. However, safety is about no surprises. 

Due to the nature of this project, the research conducted has to take several precautions. Personal health information is considered highly sensitive, so security considerations must be included. Health care is also a safety critical environment and a faulty system can result in life-threatening situations.

> Some words about different considerations my project has to take, e.g. privacy etc. Should this be where I talk about usability? Considerations when researching hospital systems 


> TK write about design science, the different steps/processes. When developing, we experiment and try things out, but when in health you don't want to do any harm.
