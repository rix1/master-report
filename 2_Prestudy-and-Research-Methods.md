As pointed out in the previous section, many before me have pointed out the need for cheaper wireless patient monitoring in both health and medical care. Some are prone to technological determinism and promote the need strictly based on technological advances [2006 System architecture WBAN u-health Otto]. I.e. "Wireless body area networks promise to revolutionize health monitoring". They emphasize on the possible economic gains of utilizing cost effective and available technology do continuous health monitoring. As well as the (possible) medical gains the increased amount of data available promise to deliver. Some focus only on in-hospital patients[SYKEHUSPASIENTER], while others have been researching remote patient monitoring outside the hospital. These different approaches ties into the development of the healthcare itself (Healthcare 3.0), which I will discuss further in Chapter 6.


### Existing research

	// summarise existing research
		// Knowledge gaps
		// research questions or goals
		// Describe similar solutions to the problem
	
	// What is done earlier to address this problem?
	// What is wrong with earlier research?

Patient monitoring has been practiced for decades. Zimmerman popularized the term PAN in 2001, which later that year was modified to body area network (BAN) in order to describe network enabled devices communication on in and near the body.

#### Patient monitoring

Continuous ECG is today captured on every patient in the post operative observation ward, as well as those in the intensive care unit. Less critical patients, that are located in other wards, may still be monitored if susceptible to heart defects. This is often done remotely through a telemetry system that wirelessly streams the captured data to a centralized observation post with 24/7 monitoring.

### Strategies and Methods

	// Overview of research strategies and methods

// TK Talk about how we found the research questions. And what process this project is going to follow. Express shortcomings in previous research.


Like in any projects studying involving people and technology there is an inherent complexity that the researchers have to unravel in order to understand the forces that guide the socio-technical systems in front of them.

When studying these systems it is important to understand why and how an artifact works in it's environment, not only that it works. This is a hot topic in the field of design and user experience, and several approaches to achieving this insight have been proposed [TK Design thinking and others]. My approach was influenced by both the Design Science methodology, my personal experience and IBM's framework for Design Thinking: Observe > Reflect > Make.

// Link your methods up to what design science say about finding data in previous research and discuss why this approach was chosen over other strategies

// Here I write about how I approached the literature review. How I gathered requirements based on interviews and how I planned my experiments.


### Data collection and analysis

	// Overview of methods of data collection and data analysis that have been used.

// TK Talk about how the information gathering was conducted, and how I am going to validate my solution. Mention some considerations that will be important for the success of this project. 


### Research Ethics

	// Discuss research ethics

Creativity plays a big role in the creation and development of any artifact, and creativity love accidents and surprises. However, safety allows no accidents and little surprises.

Due to the nature of this project, the research conducted has to take several precautions. Personal health information is considered highly sensitive, so security considerations must be included. Health care is also a safety critical environment and a faulty system can result in life-threatening situations.

// TK Some words about different considerations my project has to take, e.g. privacy etc. Should this be where I talk about usability? Considerations when researching hospital systems 

// TK write about design science, the different steps/processes. When developing, we experiment and try things out, but when in health you must consider minimize.
