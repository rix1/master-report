	[-] Introduction to the area the study is situated

This thesis presents the study and creation of an artefact that solves a practical problem of general interest. The project spanned the fall semester of 2015 and the spring semester of 2016.

During the last couple of years there has been a significant increase in the number of connected devices. Hardware is getting cheaper and smaller, and the demand for information is growing. Economic prosperity, ageing population, the growing middle income population and sensitive public policy are key demand drivers for better healthcare and infrastructure. In addition, we are expecting 4 more billion people to habit our planet within the next 90 years [2][WPP2015_Methodology.pdf]. In order to facilitate all this, we need an infrastructure that is cost effective, sustainable and scales well.

How the healthcare adapts in this time of change will have a major impact on how this expected population growth impact our societies. Today, one of the most radical changes to our current practices is likely to come from the prevalence of new sensory technology, measuring tools and techniques. These take many forms and colours, but have a set of common qualities; theyâ€™re small, energy effective and operate with one or more wireless technologies. 


## Problem statement

For this research project we wanted to investigate how feasible it is to introduce todays commercial wireless low-energy technology in a medical environment. What are the shortcomings? Where are the barriers? What are the requirements? Utilising this technology could lower the barrier of practicing modern medicine.

The motivation for this thesis started last year when I was involved in a start up working with proximity technology for the consumer market [1][cosytech]. Having a background as a medical orderly and experience with software development for health care [1][bachelor_thesis] I wanted to investigate the possibilities and shortcomings of utilising wireless, low-power technology as a medium for new sensory equipment in a hospital setting.

The main focus for this research project was the development of an artefact that solved the practical problem of ambulatory patient monitoring. As I will discuss further in section 3, this is a

Many before me have pointed out the need for cheaper wireless patient monitoring in both health and medical care. Some are prone to technological determinism and promote the need strictly based on technological advances [2006 System architecture WBAN u-health Otto]. I.e. "Wireless body area networks promise to revolutionise health monitoring". They emphasise on the possible economic gains of utilising cost effective and available technology do continuous health monitoring. As well as the (possible) medical gains the increased amount of data available promise to deliver. Some focus only on in-hospital patients[SYKEHUSPASIENTER], while others have been researching remote patient monitoring outside the hospital. These different approaches ties into the healthcare development, which I will discuss further in section HEALTHCARE_DEVELOPMENT_SECTION.

Following the Design Science methodology, our approach in this research project was fundamentally different.

**Product**
The main product of this research will be an artefact that solves the practical problem of ambulatory patient monitoring, along with the knowledge produced in the process. Towards reaching this goal, there are sub-products relating to the research questions as well as the main product. One such sub-product will take the form of a test bed comprising both software and hardware for wirelessly monitoring physiological data, connecting to different gateways and transporting data from patients to a hospital information system. This will enable us to do experiments where we can test different considerations regarding both functional and non-functional requirements. The knowledge gained will form the basis for my master thesis which is due June 2016.

**Contributions of the paper**
The rights to this research belong to Pieter Toussaint, Frank Kramer and Rikard Eide. They should all be equally attributed the results.  My main data sources will be information gathered through interviews and through literature review. It is also worth noting that the artefact created itself will represent a source of knowledge.
