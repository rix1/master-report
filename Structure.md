## 0. Preface

## 1. Introduction

[/] Introduction to the area the study is situated
[/] Describe the practical problem
[/] significance of the problem
[-] summarise existing research
	[-] Knowledge gaps
	[-] research questions or goals
	[-] Describe similar solutions to the problem
[-] Overview of research strategies and methods that have been used
[-] Summaries the contributions of the paper ,
[-] outlines the significance of these contributions
[-] describe the structure of the remainder of the paper.

## 2. Method

[-] Overview of research strategies and methods
[-] Overview of methods of data collection and data analysis that have been used.
[-] Justification for the methods.
[-] Discuss research ethics

## 3. Problem and requirements

[-] Prestudy(?)

[-] Elaborated description and analysis of the practical problem adressed.
	[-] Root cause analysis if needed.
[-] Define requirements of artefact, which are justified based on the problem analysis.
[-] Can also describe:
	[-] The process of problem analysis and requirements elicitation
	[-] The application of the selected research strategies and methods and the use of the knowlege base.

## 4. Artefact

[-] Describe artefact
[-] Explain the structure, behaviour and function, preferably with examples.
[-] Describe the development process, including:
	[-] Design alternatives
	[-] Design rationale
	[-] Knowledge base used.

(This is often the main part of a research paper)

## 5. Evaluation

[-] Describe how the artefact has been evaluated.
[-] Describe evaluation strategy and process:
	[-] How the selected research strategies and methods were applied.

## 6. Discussion

[-] Reflect on the research carried out and its contributions.
[-] Identify limitations in the study
[-] Discuss the novelty and value of the artefact (compared to existing ones).
[-] Outline the practical and theoretical significance of the contributions.
[-] Discuss ethical aspects of the use of the artefact.
[-] Suggest areas for future research.
[-] Can also reflect on design science and the application of the method framework.

## 7. Conclusion

[-] Tie the papper together and show how the research questions have been answered, or how the research goals have been achieved.
