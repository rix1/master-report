*The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate the required capabilities of a wireless monitoring system for ECG monitoring, in order to assess the feasibility of introducing Bluetooth Low Energy wireless sensors for data collection today. We will investigate how the Bluetooth technology can be evaluated experimentally for a set of use cases*

1. Is Bluetooth an appropriate protocol for medical applications such as continuous ECG monitoring? We will look at the technical qualities of Bluetooth and evaluate against the capability requirements of a wireless monitoring system with respect to practical aspects such as energy consumption, range and transfer rate. These aspects will be tested experimentally with a prototype. If applicable, what is the desired configuration?

Wireless transfer of data is a huge cost on battery. 

2. What are todays ECG monitoring practices? How can these routines be adjusted to accommodate for low energy monitoring?
