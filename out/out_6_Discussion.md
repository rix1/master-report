## Healthcare 3.0

In recent years we have seen an increased effort made by both big and small actors in the technology industry in trying to commercialize health technology. They offer devices that track and monitor activity, sleep and physical traits like weight and glucose levels to name a few [[21], [22]]. Some suggest that having more information about our health and bodies might shift the entire model of medical care; that we are now at the brink of a structural change, from a reactive to a proactive healthcare [[23], [24], [25],[26]].

One of the key players in this structural change is an affordable but rigid monitoring system that offer consumers as well as physicians good user experiences, reliable and continuous data, as well as appropriate security measures to keep the highly sensitive health information private. 

Traditionally, monitoring vital signs has been conducted only on patients in given situations or with special needs for monitoring. With sensory equipment being more affordable, it is reasonable to believe that we will be more scarce from not recording such physiological data. This data might help us understand the bigger picture of both individual and our collective health.

One drawback with the traditional medical monitoring systems like a Holter monitor [27], is that they have only been used to collect data. Data processing and analysis is done offline, and the devices often have to be sent to the manufacturer, using days or weeks before the results return [28].

What we need is a low cost, wearable, wireless system for monitoring physiological health information (PHI). This system must offer both patients and physicians the same services and level of quality they get from existing monitoring systems, but with an improved user experience and security measures to match the expectations users have from modern  consumer products.
