"# Interviews

What can we learn from the systems employed today?

Interviews with medical engineers at both hospitals revealed that both had a telemetry system from Philips installed. In both cases the network infrastructure and equipment was produced by Philips, but was delivered and maintained by different partners (Vingmed AS at Vestre Viken and HEMIT at St. Olavs) [8]. In this section I will describe the IntelliVue telemetry system from Philips, which is deployed at Norwegian hospitals today. The studying these systems were conducted in order to gain insight in the practice of wireless patient monitoring today, as well as giving us an indication of how prepared hospitals are for WBANs from a infrastructural point of view.

System architecture:

The Philips IntelliVue telemetry system is a complete end-to-end system enabling wireless monitoring of ECG data. For the medical practitioners the system is composed of two components: the TRx4841/51A wireless transceivers and the IntelliVue Information Centre. The TRx transceivers are devices for capturing ECG and SpO2 on adult and pediatric patients, and are worn by the patients. Powered by two AA batteries they stream the captured data to a custom 802.11 type router operating in the 2,4 GHz spectrum. Because Philips provide all hardware in this \"closed loop\" system, the telemetry system does not have to confine to the interoperability requirements it would needed if the system were to allow for proprietary sensors and measuring devices. The wireless interface does not strictly follow the 802.11 specification, and the system offer a \"Smart Hopping\" technology in order to reduce collisions on the already crowded 2,4 GHz network band. This is made possible by synchronizing all access points. Another noteworthy network feature is the \"make before break\" method that improves the roaming abilities. The TRx transceivers will look for new, stronger access points when they detect a decay in signal strength with the current AP. The system will make sure to connect transceivers to the new (stronger) AP before breaking with the previous one, enabling a more reliable handoff between access points.

As mentioned, this being a end to end system the IntelliVue patient monitoring suite includes transceivers, bedside monitors, access points, routers, gateways, network switches, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), processing units and databases and a optional printer [FIG][intellivue_telemetry_architecture].

Offering every piece in this architecture enables Philips and its local distributers/providers to guarantee good QoS metrics which is essential for wireless patient monitoring applications. However, installing a complete system like this comes with a substantial cost, and ties you down to just one provider for an extended period of time. The IntelliVue Telemetry system at St. Olavs was installed in 2009, and is expected to have a lifespan of at least 10 years [9]. This reduces the flexibility and increases the need for interoperability and good integrations with other systems. An example of this lack of flexibility can be found in the installation of the CorPulse ECG device from Alere. This is a device installed in emergency vehicles enabling pre-hospital ECG to be sent via a SIM card and the 3G network. This is often critical information that enable the medical staff to make informed decisions before the patient arrives at the hospital. Because this is a different system from a different provider, the hospitals we visited had installed a stand alone computer next to the information center system from Philips, that displayed the pre-hospital ECG from the Alere device. This is suboptimal not only in technical terms and with regards to maintenance, but also from a user experience point of view. The lack of integrations become yet another technical obstacle in the everyday life of medical practitioners, and ways around the barriers are found. As seen (although censored) in fig. [FIG][bilde_av_alere_ecg], credentials are often shared as a result of this, rendering the security measure useless. Based on these observations, we believe interoperable devices and services will be crucial for the success of a ubiquitous health care.

The transceivers and noise.
Although the IntelliVue wireless transceivers provide ambulatory and bedside patient monitoring, this can be a bit misleading. The system offer indeed patients the freedom of movement, but the ECG output can be heavily distorted by movement, as we saw for us self while surveying the hospitals. Accurate, unobtrusive and noise resilient sensors like the ones in [CITE][2007 EEG/ECG sensor], will be an absolute necessity in persuasive patient monitoring. Unlike multimedia streams, a physiological data stream cannot be buffered to mask jitter and latency on the receiving end. End to end latency will therefore be experienced as gaps in the monitoring stream, thereby invalidating the purpose of the system.

SIDENOTE: 
It's worth noting however that a decision support system based on data mining would usually not have the same real-time requirements and would not suffer from potential latency.


The information center
In addition, the information center provide a web view for accessing the patient data from outside the monitoring central. According to the service manuals they claim that the information displayed in the web view should be near-real time with little delay, but recommend users to always use the bedside monitor or the information center for real-time monitoring. We were unable to find a accurate metric for the end-to-end latency in IntelliVue's documentation. However, because the providers have full control over the whole infrastructure and the distances at a hospital are relatively small, it is reasonable to assume this delay is less than 2 seconds from the measurement to the information center.

An alternative approach to getting information about acceptable transmission delay would be to measure the actual network traffic in the systems deployed today. However, we were unsuccessful in getting in touch with the network administrator at either hospitals.

Information on transmission delay is also scarce in the literature we reviewed. Within the field of WBAN very few address this issue, and and we had to look into Telemedicine in order to find any suggestions to end to end latency at all. Through clinical trails, Alesanco and Garcia suggest 4 seconds as the maximum acceptable delay for a reliable real-time ECG transmission. Their research however is concerned with telemedicine over 2G/3G networks, and the intended use and QoS are different.
