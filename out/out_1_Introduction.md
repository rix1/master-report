"\n# Introduction\n\n\t\nDuring the last couple of years there has been a significant increase in the number of connected devices. Hardware is getting cheaper and smaller, and the demand for information is growing. Economic prosperity, aging population, the growing middle income population and sensitive public policy are key demand drivers for better healthcare and infrastructure. In addition, we are expecting a population growth of 4 billion within the next 90 years [3]. In order to facilitate these changes, we need infrastructure that is cost effective, sustainable and scales well.\n\nHow the healthcare adapts in this time of change will have a major impact on how this expected population growth impact our societies. Today, one of the most radical changes to our current practices is likely to come from the prevalence of new sensory technology, measuring tools and techniques, and what we manage to do with the data collected from these sensors. These sensors may take many forms, but have a set of common qualities; theyâ€™re small, energy effective and operate with one or more wireless technologies.\n\nOne possible orchestration of these sensors are in a wireless body area network, or WBAN for short. This is a collective term for wireless networks situated inside, on or around the human body. The term originated around 1995 with the idea applying wireless personal area networks (WPAN) technology to on, or in-body devices [4]. This means entire systems of devices communicating with each other in immediate proximity of a human body. Researchers have the past 20 years investigated applications, optimizations and possibilities of WBANs. The technology however, has until recent years not been small enough nor energy efficient enough for networks like these to be practically feasible for patient monitoring.\n\nElectronic patient monitoring is today an established practice at modern hospitals. It involves *repeated or continuous observations or measurements of patients, their physiological functions, and the function of the life support equipment* [5]. A monitoring system that affords good management decisions, can only be created by studying and finding the optimal compromise between several design factors; clinical, engineering and economic [6]. Because of this multidisciplinary nature, we use the following definition throughout this thesis:\n\n> A repeated or continuous measurement of the physiological functions of one or more patients.\n\nSIDENOTE: See chapter 3 for a complete overview of common metrics\n\nAn electrocardiography (ECG) test produces one example of such physiological metric. First invented by Willem Einthoven in the early 1900's, it is a technique that captures the electrical activity of the heart over time. Throughout this thesis, ECG will be used as a benchmark because of it's technical requirements.\n\n\n### Contributions of the thesis\n\n\n### Structure\n\nThe rest of this thesis is structured as follows:\nIn chapter 2 we take a look at research methods and tactics used throughout this project. We discuss research ethics considered during information gathering. Chapter 3 introduce the practical problem selected based on our research tactics, before discussing both functional and non-functional requirements for a ECG monitoring system. Chapter 4 presents different possible architectures based on the non functional requirements and others found in literature. These are compared to an architecture for wireless monitoring systems that is deployed in Norway today. Later we present an artifact designed to assess some of the required capabilities of a monitoring system supporting ambulatory patients, and its development process. Chapter 5 evaluates both the artifact and the technology, before presenting the results from the baseline functional tests of the artifact. In chapter 6 we discuss our results and identify limitations in the study, linking them up to the methods and strategies used. Having identified these gaps we end the chapter by suggesting areas for future work. Chapter 8 concludes the thesis."
