## Research Strategies and Methods

\t

Like in any projects studying involving people and technology there is an inherent complexity that the researchers have to unravel in order to understand the forces that guide the socio-technical systems in front of them.

When studying these systems it is important to understand why and how an artifact works in it's environment, not only that it works. This is complete field of research in itself, and several approaches to achieving this insight have been proposed [7]. My approach was influenced by both the Design Science methodology, my personal experience and IBM's framework for Design Thinking: Observe > Reflect > Make.





### Data collection and analysis

\t

As we will see in Chapt. 3, literature review was a major part of this research project in terms of data collection and analysis. A lot of work has been done within the field of WBANs and WSNs, and a systematic approach to gathering and analyzing and extracting knowledge from previous work was an absolute necessity. Literature was also consulted in order to learn about patient monitoring.

However, wireless technology is changing at a rapid pace and certain practical issues are directly linked to the technology in question. This puts a limit on the information and knowledge you can gather from literature. Because of this, we chose interviews as a method for gathering information about the domain and existing practices. A lot of knowledge is embedded in the people and practices of their every day routines. We used both unstructured and semi-structured interviews and with a focus on open questions. This way we were able to develop a understanding of how people viewed their work and how they interpreted the technology that was part of their everyday routines. This also made the research more flexible, and we were able to do interviews on a short notice. This strategy enabled us to talk to people in their natural working environment.

We took note of people's experience with, interpretations of, and reactions to the technical monitoring systems they had at hand. We observed what people said and did, and afterwards reflected over what they did not say or do. This way we were able to search for latent needs in the existing practices. 

Two stakeholders was selected for the survey: Medical engineers and medical practitioners. In order assess the validity of our observations, we chose to conduct interviews in two rounds on two separate hospitals, talking with stakeholders in both and comparing the results. This approach was helpful not only because we got to compare the technical solutions deployed but also the practices around patient monitoring. An alternative approach could have been to target departments higher in the organizational level like purchasing organizations, and do the comparison on the information gathered. This approach however could easily suffer from a mismatch between the general guidelines and the deployed technology as well as long turnover times, meaning a lot of time would have gone by just waiting for an answer from the respective departments.

### Scope

Due to the nature of this project, the research conducted would ideally take several safety and security considerations. Personal health information is considered highly sensitive, and health care is also a safety critical environment. A faulty system can result in life-threatening situations, and ensuring privacy is of outmost importance. However, in order to reduce the scope, the security features of a wireless monitoring system has not been the main focus of this research.

Should this be where I talk about usability? Considerations when researching hospital systems
