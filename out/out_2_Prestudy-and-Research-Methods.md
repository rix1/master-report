"# Prestudy and Research Methods\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nMany have pointed out the need for cheaper wireless patient monitoring in both health and medical care. Some are prone to technological determinism and promote the need strictly based on technological advances [7]. They emphasize on the possible economic gains of utilizing cost effective and available technology do continuous health monitoring. As well as the medical gains the increased amount of data available promise to deliver. In this chapter we will survey existing research, and give a more in-depth presentation of the topics and domains involved in the multidisciplinary world of patient monitoring. This rest of the chapter is organized as follows: \n\n\n## Prestudy\n\n\n\n### Identifying the Gap\n\nBefore literature surveys, we reached out to people in the industry. According to the mission statement and in line with the Design Science methodology, we wanted to identify a practical problem experienced when dealing with sensory equipment today. We talked to physicians and nurses dealing with ECG monitoring and telemetry. In some cases the department did not have the necessary telemetry equipment for monitoring ambulatory patients. Other times the task of installing the new equipment just so that the patient could take a walk was not carried out because there was no imminent risk of heart failure. In both cases the medical staff expressed discontent with this practice. \"To see how a recovering heart reacts to physical movement post surgery could give valuable insight in how successful a surgery was. But today, the required administration needed to record such data stops us from getting this insight.\", explained Dr. Eide of Kiel University Hospital.\n\n### Patient Monitoring\n\nContinuous ECG is today captured on every patient in the post operative observation ward, as well as those in the intensive care unit. Less critical patients, that are located in other wards, may still be monitored if susceptible to heart defects. This is often done remotely through a telemetry system that wirelessly streams the captured data to a centralized observation post with 24/7 monitoring.\n\n\n### ECG\n\nSIDENOTE: When observing the telemetry readings I got to see for myself show sensitive the electrodes were to noise. One patient graph was suddenly extremely fuzzy and noisy. I was told this was normal and probably caused by movement like walking, scratching or something similar. Reducing this noise would of course be a major consideration when implementing a system that enables ambulatory monitoring [8]\n\n### Bluetooth\n\n\n#### WBANs\n\nSIDENOTE: IoT Gateways. It is claimed that the internet of things has a gateway problem [9]. This is an interesting topic that is worth discussing shortly. In their 2015 article, Zachariah et al. illustrates how the coming coming wave of IoT devices does not enjoy the same level of ubiquitous and universal access to the Internet as WIFI and cellular network enabled devices. The point is valid; for a BLE enabled device today to connect to internet these devices require an application layer gateway, that is able to translate data from the energy-efficient link to the Internet. There are however, much resources being put into creating new protocols, schemes and additions to existing standards in order to create this ubiquitous experience.\nthere is a difference between low-power and low-energy\n\n\n### Existing research\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\nPatient monitoring has been practiced for decades. Zimmerman popularized the term PAN in 2001, which later that year was modified to body area network (BAN) in order to describe network enabled devices communication on in and near the body.\n\n\n## Research Strategies and Methods\n\n\t\n\nLike in any projects studying involving people and technology there is an inherent complexity that the researchers have to unravel in order to understand the forces that guide the socio-technical systems in front of them.\n\nWhen studying these systems it is important to understand why and how an artifact works in it's environment, not only that it works. This is complete field of research in itself, and several approaches to achieving this insight have been proposed [10]. My approach was influenced by both the Design Science methodology, my personal experience and IBM's framework for Design Thinking: Observe > Reflect > Make.\n\n\n\n\n### Data collection and analysis\n\n\t\n\nOther than literature reviews, we chose interviews as the main method for gathering information about the domain and existing practices. This was because a lot of knowledge is embedded in the people and practices of their every day routines. We used both unstructured and semi-structured interviews and with a focus on open questions. This way we were able to develop a understanding of how people viewed their work and how they interpreted the technology that was part of their everyday routines. This also made the research more flexible, and we were able to do interviews on a short notice, which enabled us to talk to people in their natural working environment. We took note of people's experience with, interpretations of, and reactions to the technical monitoring systems they had at hand. We observed what people said and did, and afterwards reflected over what they did not say or do. This way we were able to search for latent needs in the existing practices. In order to validate and confirm these observations, our approach involved comparing the practices and technology used at two different Norwegian hospitals, Vestre Viken HF and St. Olavs Hospital.\n\n### Research Ethics\n\n\t\nCreativity plays a big role in the creation and development of any artifact, and creativity love accidents and surprises. However, safety allows no accidents and little surprises.\n\nDue to the nature of this project, the research conducted has to take several precautions. Personal health information is considered highly sensitive, so security considerations must be included. Health care is also a safety critical environment and a faulty system can result in life-threatening situations.\n\n\n"
