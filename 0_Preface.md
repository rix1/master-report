Electronic patient monitoring has been practiced at hospitals for almost half a century[1][patient_monitoring_history]. Metrics like ECG, arterial blood pressure, SpO2, respiratory rate and body temperature are measured on every patient in a modern intensive care unit. The consumer industry (that typically is driving the technological change) have the last couple of years also showed interest in capturing physiological data. With this interest comes new ideas, new solutions and new technology from a industry that has a customer centric focus. Where the consumer industry is working towards a "connected self", the health care has over the years grown into a collaboration of isolated silos. Having the ability to monitor all of these metrics together wirelessly holds potential to reduce cables and ease everyday routines, as well as giving ambulatory patients the freedom to move. However, there is a wide array of different measuring techniques and wireless protocols that all have different capabilities with inherent strengths and weaknesses. Further, the technical requirements to each the measurement may vary according to the use case and patient's condition. This is a big obstacle in the implementation of such monitoring systems.

The purpose of this master thesis is to investigate and assess the required capabilities of a wireless monitoring system and investigate how these capability requirements can be adressed experimentally.


## Abstract

Utilising this technology could lower the barrier of practicing modern medicine.

## Preface


This thesis is the result of a collaboration between the Department of Computer and Information Science (IDI) and Department of Telematics (IT) at NTNU and was conducted during the fall and spring semester 2015/2016.

For this research project we originally wanted to investigate how feasible it is to introduce todays commercial wireless low-energy technology in a medical environment. What were the shortcomings? Where are the barriers? What are the requirements? As discussed in section 2, our approach to this was the development of an artefact that solved the practical problem of ambulatory patient monitoring.

<!-- Due to the nature of the research this focus has been shifted and changed along the way, which resulted in the need for a more general problem statement. -->
